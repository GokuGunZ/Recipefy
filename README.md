# Recipefy
Recipefy is a Java Desktop Application with a Swing GUI made for a University Project. 
Developed throught *Unified Process*, implements different _GRASP_ and _GoF_ Patterns in a _MVC Architecture_.
It should be the client side of a "Recipe Social Network" application. 

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is creating a software application that allows you to collect all your personal recipes in one space, share them with others and collect the others’.
Each user will be characterized by personal data and authentication data. The recipes will contain different information about their preparation, such as ingredients
and instructions, and also about their classification, such as cuisine type or nutritional information. In a second step the application will expect to have a more sophisticated
user type division, with elements like ‘Chefs’ and ‘Dietitians’. Chef will be able to share their restaurant information with recipes of some of their plates served in their
restaurant. Dietitians will be able to create some diets, made with all the shared recipes in the system, and share them to different users.
